## Reverse Engineering 100: Corruptbattle

**Challenge**  
Can you find my unique blockchain address inside a corrupted and scrambled program , remember the blockchain address is of 42 chars.

**Solution**  
For this challenge, we are provided with a binary, and based on the description we have to find a blockchain address that is 42 chars long

So we start analyzing the binary

itâ€˜s a 64 bit ELF binary so we open IDA and we start checking the disassembly

We notice that there is more than one function called main so after having a look we notice that in the function main_one the binary is loading a hex

We take that string and with python, we check the length:

So its length is 42 so we submit and its the flag
